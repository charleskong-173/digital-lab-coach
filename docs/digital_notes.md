## .dig File Format

### Top-level structure

- Root element: `<circuit>`
- Two main children: `<visualElements>` (components), `<wires>` (connections)
- Wires are geometric (`p1`, `p2` coordinates), not pin-typed — must match endpoints to component pin positions
- Subcircuits referenced as `<elementName>filename.dig</elementName>`
- `<version>2</version>` is the current `.dig` format version
- `<measurementOrdering/>` appears (empty) at the end of every file

### Attribute parsing quirks

- Most `<entry>` values are `<int>`, `<long>`, `<boolean>`, or `<string>`.
- **`<rotation rotation="N"/>`** stores `N` as an XML *attribute*, not text content. Common parser mistake is to read `value.text` (returns `None`) and fall back to the tag name `"rotation"`. Must extract via `element.get("rotation")` and cast to `int`. Values are 0/1/2/3 for 0°/90°/180°/270°.
- Unrecognized `<elementAttributes>` value tags (`<testData>`, `<shape>`, etc.) should be preserved as raw text so nothing is silently lost.

### Element types encountered in 311 labs

### Pin geometry (offsets from anchor, verified empirically)

Digital's coordinate system: x increases rightward, y increases downward. Anchor is the `<pos>` of the visual element. Pin coords = anchor + offset, with rotation applied to the offset before adding the anchor.

| Element | Inputs (left edge) | Outputs (right edge) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Not` | `A` (0, 0) | `Y` (40, 0) | Width 40 |
| `And`/`Or`/`XOr` (wideShape=True, even N) | Two halves with **40-unit gap** in the middle | `Y` (80, center_y) | Verified empirically. N=2 → (0,0),(0,40); N=4 → (0,0),(0,20),(0,60),(0,80); N=6 → (0,0),(0,20),(0,40),(0,80),(0,100),(0,120) |
| `And`/`Or`/`XOr` (wideShape=True, odd N) | `in_i` at (0, i*20) — uniform | `Y` (80, center_y) | Tested via three_inputand, five_inputand (tests pass with full I→O); offsets match wire endpoints exactly |
| `And`/`Or`/`XOr` (wideShape=False) | Assumed `in_i` at (0, i*20) | Assumed `Y` (80, center_y) | **Not yet observed in any sample.** Code uses the same uniform-20 path as wideShape+odd. Will verify when we encounter one in the field |
| `NAnd`/`NOr`/`XNOr` (any) | same as positive variants | Output bubble pushes visible pin ~20 right; absorbed by snap tolerance | Only wideShape=True observed (single_nand) |
| `In`/`Out`/`Const`/`Clock`/`Ground`/`VDD` | single pin at anchor (0, 0) | | |
| `Tunnel` | single bidir pin at anchor | | NetName unifies across the circuit |
| `Multiplexer` (sel_bits=1, n=2) | `in0` (0, 0), `in1` (0, 40), `sel` (20, 40) | `out` (40, 20) | **Different spacing for 2-input vs 4+** |
| `Multiplexer` (sel_bits≥2, n≥4) | `in_i` at (0, i*20), `sel` at (20, n*20) | `out` at (40, n*10) | |
| `Splitter` | `in_i` at (0, i*spacing) | `out_i` at (20, i*spacing) | spacing = 20 × `splitterSpreading` (default 1, can be 2+) |
| `Register` | `D` (0, 0), `C` (0, 20), `en` (0, 40) | `Q` (60, 20) | `en` always present even when tied to Const(1) |
| `Comparator` | `A` (0, 0), `B` (0, 20) | `gr` (60, 0), `eq` (60, 20), `le` (60, 40) | Width **60**, not 80 — common mistake |
| `Add` | `a` (0, 0), `c_i` (0, 20), `b` (0, 40) | `s` (60, 0), `c_o` (60, 20) | Width **60**, c_o at y=20 not y=40 — verified for Bits=1, 4, 32. Earlier-assumed (80, 40) layout for c_o consistently snapped to wire L-bends and produced phantom multi-drivers |
| `BitExtender` | `in` (0, 0) | `out` (80, 0) | Width varies with outputBits; snap tolerance absorbs ±20 |
| `BarrelShifter` | `in` (0, 0), `sh` (0, 40) | `out` (60, 20) | |
| `ROM` | `A` (0, 0), `sel` (0, 40) | `D` (80, 20) | Width varies with data width |
| `Decoder` | `sel` (20, n_outputs * 20) | `out_i` at (60, i*20) | sel sits bottom-middle (same pattern as Mux n≥4) |
| `PriorityEncoder` | `in_i` at (0, i*20) | `num` (80, 0) | |

### Rotation

- Rotation index N applies a 90°×N counter-clockwise rotation to every pin offset *before* adding the anchor.
- In screen coordinates (y growing down), CCW visual = math CW.
- Formula: `(dx, dy)` → `(dy, -dx)` for N=1, `(-dx, -dy)` for N=2, `(-dy, dx)` for N=3.
- Verified empirically against a rotated Multiplexer (rotation=1, sel_bits=1) in `register-file.dig` and a rotated Splitter (rotation=2) in `cpu.dig`.

### Gates

- Gate multi-input attribute is `Inputs` (`<int>`), absent = 2.
- Gate anchor = TOP input pin, not center.
- For `wideShape=True` with even `N≥4`, the input column has a 40-unit gap in the middle (so the output sits centered between the halves).

### Wires

- A `<wire>` has exactly two endpoints: `<p1>` and `<p2>`, each with x/y coordinates.
- Wires carry NO pin or signal-type information.
- Connectivity is INFERRED: wires sharing an endpoint coordinate form a net.
- Each `<wire>` is one straight segment between two points (may be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
- A visual corner is NOT one bent wire — it's two separate `<wire>` segments sharing an endpoint coordinate. An L-path = 2 wires, a path with 2 turns = 3 wires.
- **Diagonal wires**: Digital allows non-Manhattan wires. They connect their endpoints normally via union-find, but our T-junction detection currently skips them (no observed cases needing it).
- **Mid-wire branch points** (T-junctions): a wire endpoint may land on the *interior* of another wire, not just at its endpoint. Net-building must treat any shared coordinate — not just endpoints — as a potential connection. Implemented via `_midpoint_branches` scanning each horizontal/vertical wire for foreign endpoints landing strictly between p1 and p2.

### Real bug patterns the parser must surface

- **Dangling input** — input pin with no wire endpoint at its predicted coord. Detected as a singleton net containing only sink-direction pins.
- **Multi-driver** — two or more outputs feeding the same net. Detected by `len(net.drivers()) > 1`.
- **Combinational loop** — cycle of purely combinational gates without a clocked register breaking it. Detected via `networkx.simple_cycles(g)` (clock filtering deferred to F8).
- **Bit-width mismatch** — N-bit signal feeding an M-bit pin. Requires splitter bit-range parsing and per-net width inference (F6 prerequisite).
- **Miswire / wrong-pin / wrong-input-position** — connected to wrong pin, surfaces as a failed test vector. Layer 1 sees a valid topology; Layer 3 detects the semantic mismatch.

Digital does NOT flag multi-driver on load. The error only surfaces at simulation time, and only when a signal actually traverses the conflicted net.

### Wire endpoint degree as a pin-vs-routing classifier

A wire endpoint at coord X is **degree N** if N wires terminate there. Used by net builder:
- Degree 1 = a real pin location (exactly one wire ends there). Candidates for snapping or implicit-pin attachment.
- Degree ≥ 2 = L-bend or T-junction routing point. Excluded from implicit-pin assignment to prevent misclaim.

### Pin snap / implicit attachment

The net builder uses two-stage pin attachment:

1. **Predicted-pin snap** (for known-geometry elements): for each (pin, endpoint) pair within `PIN_SNAP_TOLERANCE` (Manhattan distance ≤ 30), build all triples sorted by distance. Walk in sorted order and claim each pair only if neither side already claimed. Multiple pins at the *exact same coord* (distance 0) can share an endpoint.
2. **Implicit-pin attach** (for no-geometry components, mostly subcircuit references): unclaimed degree-1 endpoints get assigned to the nearest no-geometry component within `IMPLICIT_PIN_RADIUS` (= 500). Per-instance cap = `child.inputs() + child.outputs()`; if more endpoints claim the instance than the cap allows, the farthest are dropped.

Dangling **outputs** are dropped from the netlist (they're not errors — just unused). Dangling **inputs** are kept as singleton nets so F5 can detect them as bugs.

## Layer-1 vs Layer-3 detection responsibility

| Bug category | Layer 1 (deterministic) | Layer 3 (LLM) |
|---|:-:|:-:|
| Dangling input pin | ✓ catches | ✓ explains |
| Multi-driver short | ✓ catches | ✓ explains routing intent |
| Combinational loop | ✓ catches | ✓ describes the cycle |
| Width mismatch | ✓ catches (with F6) | ✓ explains |
| Missing subcircuit file | ✓ catches | ✓ suggests fix |
| **Semantic miswire** | ✗ | ✓ (only Layer 3 can know intent) |
| **Wrong input-position** | ✗ | ✓ |
| **Wrong op-encoding**  | ✗ | ✓ |
| **Routing accident through unrelated pin coord** | ✓ catches (multi-driver) but cannot explain | ✓ explains |

The ablation contrast (Layer 1 alone vs Layer 1+3 vs Layer 3 alone) is the project's central evaluation. The 30 buggy benchmark is split across all three columns.

## Digital UI Features Relevant to Students

### Debugging tools that exist natively
- Single-step simulation
- Test case runner with pass/fail output

### What students struggle with (from ULA experience)
- Wire routing accidents that look right visually but short signals through an unrelated component's pin coord (mazes).
- Forgetting to wire `en` on a Register.
- More components, more possible bits width mismatch, whereas Digital does not do an ideal job to instantly point the bug
- Multi-driver shorts that don't surface at load time and only become apparent through unexpected test failures.
- Subcircuit reference path issues when sharing labs across machines.

### Features we'd want DLC to add or enhance
- Inline highlighting of dangling pins / multi-driver nets at edit time (before simulation).
- Component-level reachability annotation ("this output is unused", "this input is undriven").

## Parser scope policy

DLC's parser aims to **semantically understand** elements used in COMP 311 labs so far. Other elements (transistor primitives, FPGA-specific blocks, FSM editor outputs, etc.) are parsed structurally but treated as opaque `UnknownComponent` with named pins for now. This lets the analyzer skip unrecognized components and the LLM describe them generically, while keeping the parser future-proof for new labs.

**Known-and-semantically-supported**:
Wire (straight, L, diagonal), And, Or, XOr, NAnd, NOr, XNOr, Not, In, Out, Multiplexer, Splitter, Tunnel, ROM, Register, Const, Comparator, Add, BitExtender, Clock, Ground, VDD, BarrelShifter, Decoder, PriorityEncoder, Testcase, Rectangle.

**Annotation-only** (parsed but explicitly carry no signal pins): Testcase, Rectangle. Excluded from implicit-pin candidate set.

**Out of initial scope** (parsed but opaque, may be added later):
all transistor-level elements, FSM elements, FPGA-board-specific blocks, Verilog wrappers, GAL/JEDEC-specific elements.

## CLI Mode (what the autograder uses)

- Command: `java -cp Digital.jar CLI test -circ FILE.dig`
- Output format: `Test: passed` or `Test: failed (N%)` per test case
- Exit codes:

## Subcircuit Resolution

- A circuit referencing `alu.dig` means Digital looks for `alu.dig` in the same directory or library path.
- For our parser: recursively load referenced subcircuits to fully analyze a top-level circuit.
- Subcircuit cache is per-parse-session — same `.dig` referenced N times is loaded once. Circular references raise.
- A referenced file with a bare name may live in any subfolder; we search recursively and pick the shallowest match (ambiguity is flagged but doesn't fail the parse).
- **Subcircuit instance pin direction resolution**: the instance has no native geometry, so direction is inferred by splitting the instance's implicit pins at the x-midpoint (left = inputs, right = outputs), sorting each side by y, and zipping against the child circuit's `In`/`Out` elements sorted by y. Implicit-pin count is capped to the child's port count to prevent over-claim from neighboring routing.

## Known limitations to revisit (Keep updating during path 1 development)

1. **Splitter bit-range parsing** — `"25-31, 24-20, …"` strings are stored as raw text. F3/F6 prerequisite.
2. **Cycle filtering for clocked feedback** — `simple_cycles(g)` finds all cycles, including legitimate Register feedback through Clock. F8 needs to subtract cycles passing through a clocked element.
3. **Stable component IDs across edits** — currently `enumerate(components)` index; will need content-hash or position-hash for diff reports.

## Open Questions under investigation

- How does Digital handle missing subcircuit files? (Investigating)
- Does Digital's CLI mode produce structured output (JSON?) or only human-readable text? (Investigating)
- Where exactly does Java plugin API expose hooks for adding analysis panels? (Path 3 question, defer investigation)
